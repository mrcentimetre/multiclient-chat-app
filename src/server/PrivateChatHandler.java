 * - ClientHandler.handleMessage() at ClientHandler.java:149
 *
 * This file exists only to match the original folder structure.
 * You can leave it empty or add utility methods if needed in the future.
 *
 * Original design had this as a separate handler, but it's more efficient
 * to handle private messages directly in the Server class.
